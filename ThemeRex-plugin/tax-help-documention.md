### XD Files & Images

IMPORTANT! We do not include theme-related `.XD` files into the theme package, because it significantly increases the theme archive size. If you need those files, feel free to submit a [support request](https://themerex.net/support/).

Nevertheless, you can request the **.XD files** by contacting our [support department](https://themerex.net/support/).

By getting this WordPress Theme you get all the images **FOR FREE**. Moreover, you can use them on **ANY OF YOUR PROJECTS**!

### Bundled Plug-ins

The theme package contains a number of [bundled plug-ins](https://1.envato.market/c/1262870/275988/4415?subId1=ancora&u=help.market.envato.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F213762463-Bundled-Plugins-).

If a new version of a bundled plug-in is available, it will be included in the next theme release. You can also request it by submitting a [support ticket](https://themerex.net/support/).

Bundled plug-ins are fully functional without the activation using a registration license key. In case you are willing to receive automatic updates and support from the plug-in team, you will need to purchase the plug-in separately. Only the direct buyers get the plug-in license key.

## Installation

### WordPress Information

To install this theme you must have a working version of WordPress already installed. Below are some useful links regarding WordPress information.

-   [WordPress FAQ](http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_New_To_WordPress) - General information about WordPress.
-   [WordPress Lessons](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-lessons) - A great knowledge-base for WordPress beginners.
-   [PHP Function References](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference) - Detailed information on WordPress PHP functions and a lot of usage examples.

### Theme Requirements

To use this theme you must be running at least **WordPress 5.0**, **PHP 5.6.20** or higher (for _Booked_ and _WooCommerce_ plug-ins **PHP 7.0+**). If you use a hosting service with limited resources (e.g. GoDaddy!), you may experience issues with the "one-click" demo data installation.

We recommend that you contact your web hosting service provider to make sure that your server PHP configuration limits are as follows:

-   `max_execution_time 600`
-   `memory_limit 128M`
-   `post_max_size 32M`
-   `upload_max_filesize 32M`

If you are running unmanaged dedicated server or VPS, you should check your `php.ini` file. Alternatively, you can edit `.htaccess` file in the root of your website and add the following values:

-   `php_value max_execution_time 600`
-   `php_value memory_limit 128M`
-   `php_value post_max_size 32M`
-   `php_value upload_max_filesize 32M`

Setting these values will ensure you will not get error messages during the installation. To safeguard your website, please use secure passwords and the latest version of WordPress and plug-ins.

Here is the list of web hosting service providers we recommend:

-   [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/themerex/doc) _(Exclusive Offer for our Customers: **\-70% OFF**)_
-   [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/go/themerexdiscount)
-   [InMotion Hosting](https://inmotion-hosting.evyy.net/c/402468/260033/4222?u=https://www.inmotionhosting.com/wordpress-hosting-promo)

### Theme Installation

#### Unpacking the theme

Before installing the theme, please make sure you unpacked the archive and extracted the theme files. Some of the folders names may slightly vary. Treat the screenshot below as an example only. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/unzipped_theme.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/unzipped_theme.png)

_The main package contains archives with the main theme, child theme, documentation and bundled plug-ins._

If you try to install the wrong files, you will get the _missing style.css_ error. This is the most common error that means you are trying to install an incorrect package.

In order to install the theme, you need to have a working version of WordPress installed on your server first. Check out this [guide](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress) for detailed information on how to install WordPress. We also highly recommend updating your WordPress to the latest stable version.

Below you can find a video tutorial on how to install the theme.

  

**There are 2 ways to install the theme:**

-   **via FTP**:
    1.  Log into your web server with FTP client software.
    2.  Unzip the `tax-help.zip` file and ONLY use the extracted `/tax-help` theme folder.
    3.  Upload the extracted `tax-help` theme folder into `/wp-content/themes`.
    4.  Navigate to the **Appearance > Themes** tab and activate the theme.
-   **via WordPress admin panel**:
    1.  Log into the WordPress admin panel.
    2.  Navigate to **Appearance > Themes** and click on **Add New** and **Upload Theme**.
    3.  Select the `tax-help.zip` folder and click **Install Now** button.
    4.  After the successful installation, click on **Activate** or navigate to the **Appearance > Themes** and click on **Activate** button to activate the newly installed theme.
    5.  Install and activate **ThemeREX Addons** plug-in.
    6.  Enter your **Purchase Code** or **Envato Elements Token** and some personal information. Theme activation allows you to get access to plug-ins, demo content, support and updates.  
          
        To get the **purchase code**, please navigate to your **ThemeForest "Downloads" page** and click on the theme download link. Check this [guide](https://1.envato.market/c/1262870/275988/4415?subId1=ancora&u=help.market.envato.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F202822600-Where-Is-My-Purchase-Code-) for more details.  
          
        In case you have downloaded the theme from **Envato Elements**, please view our [guide](https://themerex.net/wp/how-to-activate-the-theme-using-envato-elements-token/) to find out how to generate Envato Elements token. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_activation.png) ](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_activation.png)IMPORTANT! _The number of theme activations (with purchase code/Envato Elements token) is **LIMITED**! For Envato Elements, if you want to activate another theme, please generate a new token (1 token = 1 domain). Anyway, you are allowed to activate your theme locally or on the dev server and then move the theme to the main domain. Please feel free to contact our [support department](https://themerex.net/support/) if any issues arise._
    7.  Make sure the required **Advanced Theme Add-ons** are active. You can find the description of each add-on [here](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#theme_addons). [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/advanced_theme_addons.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/advanced_theme_addons.png)

_You can also watch our [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/6GInaB_7MdA) on how to install a WordPress theme._

Attention! If you want to make changes in theme’s templates or functions, we strongly recommend activating a child theme before demo data installation. Please see the [Child Theme](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#installation_child_theme) section for more information.

The theme license allows you to install the theme on **ONE domain** only! In order to connect the license to a different domain, first click "Disconnect domain" (**Theme Panel > Theme Dashboard > General**) and then re-enter the purchase key/token on a different WordPress installation. For Envato Elements, if you want to activate another theme or install the same theme on a new domain, please generate a new token (1 token = 1 domain). If you have any questions, please contact our [support department](https://themerex.net/support/). [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/domain_disconnection.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/domain_disconnection.png)

Attention! Before any manipulations that will require re-entering the purchase key/Elements token even on the same domain (e.g: WordPress reinstallation or cleaning the database), please **FIRST disconnect the domain**!

### Plug-ins Installation

**Below is the list of the plug-ins that come included into the theme.**  
Some of these plug-ins can also be installed from the [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) repository.

-   Advanced Popups
-   Booked Appointments
-   Contact Form 7
-   Cookie Information _(formerly WP GDPR Compliance)_
-   Elegro Crypto Payment
-   Elementor **_(required)_**
-   MailChimp for WordPress
-   Slider Revolution
-   ThemeREX Addons **_(required)_**
-   ThemeREX Updater
-   TI WooCommerce Wishlist
-   WooCommerce

You can find a detailed overview of each plug-in in the [Plug-ins section](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#extra_plugins) of this documentation file.

There is only one required plug-in for proper theme functioning, and that is **ThemeREX Addons**. The rest of the plug-ins are recommended for installation, but not required.

To make the theme look exactly as on the demo page, you would need to install the recommended plug-ins:

1.  After the installation/activation of ThemeREX Addons plug-in and theme activation, you will see a prompt with a list of plug-ins to install. Click on the _Begin installing plugins_ link or go to **Appearance > Install Plugins**.  
    
    [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/required_plugins_hint.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/required_plugins_hint.png)
    
2.  Check the plug-ins you want to install, select the **Install** option and click **Apply**. Installation may take a few minutes, please be patient and do not refresh the page.  
    
    [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/required_plugins_apply_button.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/required_plugins_apply_button.png)
    
3.  Now, activate the plug-ins. Go to **Appearance > Install Plugins**, check all the listed plug-ins, choose **Activate** option and click Apply.

In case you are running a shared hosting with limited resources (e.g. GoDaddy), we do recommend enabling only the essential plug-ins (e.g. ThemeREX Addons, Elementor) and disable the rest. Otherwise, it may significantly increase the memory consumption, which might lead to unwanted issues.

PLEASE NOTE! The installation and activation of **bundled plug-ins** run **automatically**. Anyway, if you have any issues, please extract `plugins.zip` archive (from the theme package) and proceed with the plug-ins installation **manually**.

#### Gutenberg Compatibility

Our theme is compatible with [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) page builder. You can **create new pages** using this editor, though you can still use pre-built custom header and footer layouts.

All existing demo pages and layouts are built through Elementor Page Builder and should be customized via Elementor ONLY.

PLEASE NOTE! It is possible to switch between the page builders. Please use One page builder for creating/customizing One particular page/post/layout.

### Child Theme

If you want to make changes to the theme's files and functions, we **strongly recommend** installing a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/). This ensures that your theme customizations stay in place after the theme update. If you are not planning to change the core theme files, you are free to skip this chapter.

IMPORTANT! Install the child theme before importing the demo data. Otherwise, all of your theme options will be reset.

A child theme is installed the same way you install a parent theme. Locate the `tax-help-child.zip` file in the theme package and upload it via the WordPress admin panel. Alternatively, you can unzip it and upload via FTP (see [main theme installation](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#installation_via_ftp) chapter).

#### Using a Child Theme

Your child theme has its own `functions.php` file. Use it to copy modified functions from the parent theme's `functions.php`, or register new functions.

You can **copy all files** from the parent theme into the child theme **except** files located in the following folders:

-   `/includes`
-   `/plugins`
-   `/theme-options`
-   `/theme-specifics`

In the `/front-page` folder, you can copy all files except `front-page.options.php`.

If the file you want to edit is in one of these folders, you need to copy the required function from that file, and register it in the child theme's `functions.php`.

The rest of the files can be copied and edited directly in the child theme folder.

When copying parent theme files into the child theme, **_preserve the original folder structure_**. Create respective folders and make sure that the file path is the same as in the parent theme.

### Demo Content

Our theme includes a simple **One-click demo data installation**, which allows your site to look exactly as on the theme demo.

Before installing demo data, please make sure you have activated your theme copy (entered the purchase code or Envato Elements token in the **WP Dashboard > Theme Panel > Theme Dashboard > General** tab) and installed all the required plug-ins. Check the [Plug-ins installation](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#installation_plugins_installation) section for more information about the required plug-ins.

In case you do not have your _Purchase Code_, please navigate to your ThemeForest "Downloads" page and click on the theme download link. Check this [guide](https://1.envato.market/c/1262870/275988/4415?subId1=ancora&u=help.market.envato.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F202822600-Where-Is-My-Purchase-Code-) for more details.

To generate **Envato Elements token**, follow the link from your WP admin panel. Please view this [guide](https://themerex.net/wp/how-to-activate-the-theme-using-envato-elements-token/) for more information.

IMPORTANT! Our theme supports **RTL** text direction **_(compatibility, without rtl-demo content)_**! Please FIRST choose the **correct language** in your WordPress settings (Dashboard > Settings > General > Site Language), then proceed with the demo data installation.  
  
Our theme contains RTL styles. The page content should be manually adjusted for RTL text-direction using Elementor settings (e.g. changing the alignment of icons, etc).

In order to import the demo content go to **Theme Panel (WP Dashboard) > Theme Dashboard > Demo Data**.

![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/install_demo_menu.png)

On the page that showed up set the required parameters.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/install_demo_settings.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/install_demo_settings.png)

#### Partial Import

When choosing the partial demo data import, the new content will be added to your existing data.

Although this will _not_ overwrite your existing content, we still **recommend backing up your website** before doing this.

_Note, that the pages are imported without the original images. Instead, the image placeholders are used. This is done to keep your existing content intact._

Import separate pages means that you receive the page structured like on our demo, just widgets set that requires further customization: you should replace demo [categories/post ids](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/customization_category_ids.png) with your own ones.

#### Full Import

**When choosing this option, _all the existing content_ of your website _will be lost_ and replaced with the new data. We recommend using this option for new WordPress installations only.**

Use the full import option if you want to have an **exact copy of the theme demo**. It enables you to import all media files, pages, theme options, and plug-in settings.

Some plug-ins increase the memory consumption. For example, **BuddyPress** and **bbPress** (not included into the theme's package) require additional `60-80Mb`. If you are having trouble installing the demo data, deactivate massive plug-ins and try again.

In case **demo data installation** is stuck and you see _"Error load data from the file ... " error message_, you can manually install it by downloading the **default.zip** archive with demo data from our [server](https://demofiles.ancorathemes.com/tax-help-new/demo/default.zip). The archive should be unzipped. Then create `demo/` folder in `wp-content/themes/tax-help/` directory and copy `/default` folder to `wp-content/themes/tax-help/demo`.

_Treat the screenshot below as an example only. The list of folders inside a theme package may vary._

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/install-demo-folder-skin.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/install-demo-folder-skin.png)

If the issue persists, please contact your hosting service provider to make sure that your server configuration meets the [Theme Requirements](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#installation_theme_requirements). Otherwise, please refer your request to our [support department](https://themerex.net/support/).

### Installation FAQs

##### [_"Link is expired - Try again"_ when uploading the theme in admin panel.](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#collapseOne)

There are two ways to solve this problem.

1.  Contact your web hosting service provider to increase your `upload_max_filesize` to `80M`.
2.  Upload the extracted theme package via an FTP client to `wp-content/themes` directory.

##### [Fatal error: Allowed memory size of xx bytes exhausted (tried to allocate xx bytes).](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#collapseTwo)

The error occurs because of the low `memory_limit`. You can increase `memory_limit` on your server in several ways, namely by editing:

1.  wp-config.php file: `define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '128M');`
2.  php.ini: `memory_limit = 128M;`
3.  .htaccess file: `php_value memory_limit 128M;`

##### [Fatal error: Call to undefined function `mb_strtolower()` in ….](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#collapseThree)

Please contact your web hosting service provider to enable `mbstring PHP` function in server settings. The function is needed for some languages, such as Japanese, Chinese etc. In case you can not enable the settings, please contact the [support team](https://themerex.net/support/) to get assistance with disabling the function in the theme.

##### [If you get a message to enter your FTP details when uploading the theme, this is connected with different file/folder owners.](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#collapseFour)

Edit `wp-config.php` file and add the following lines after database information:

-   `define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' );`
-   `define('FS_CHMOD_DIR', 0770);`
-   `define('FS_CHMOD_FILE', 0660);`

##### [Demo data import does not work.](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#collapseFive)

Please contact your web hosting service provider to make sure that your PHP configuration limits are as follows:

-   `max_execution_time 600`
-   `memory_limit 128M`
-   `post_max_size 32M`
-   `upload_max_filesize 32M`

  
Then re-import demo data - it will be successful. In case you still have any issues, please contact our [support team](https://themerex.net/support/).

##### [The import is stuck on Media.](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#collapseSix)

Please unselect "Media" in the list on the "Install demo data" screen and import the rest of the data. Our Support team can provide the demo media archive, so you could upload media via FTP, just submit a [support ticket](https://themerex.net/support/).

### Theme Update

This step is required if you received the notification that a new version of the theme is available. You can see this information in Changelog section at the bottom of the item's details page.

Before you go ahead with the update **make sure to backup your old theme's folder**. Download it to your computer locally.

#### Update your version to 2.0.0 (for versions 1.2.0 and lower ONLY!)

IMPORTANT! Theme version 2.0.0 is built using **NEW page builder**, that is why all old shortcodes (\[trx\_section\], \[trx\_chat\], \[trx\_columns\], etc.) WILL NOT work any more. You should **reassemble** all existing content through **Elementor page builder**. In case you prefer _WPBakery Page Builder_, the set of shortcodes will be limited to default WPBakery Page Builder's shortcodes.

**Please follow the steps below in order to update your version properly:**

1.  Make FULL BACKUP of your website database. You can also export your content as an `xml` file. Navigate to **Tools (WP Database) > Export**, choose "All content" and click on "Download Export file" button.
2.  Deactivate "ThemeREX Utilities" plug-in before deactivating the theme or uploading a new theme version!
3.  Create the **backup of the theme folder** `wp-content/themes/tax-help`. You may download it to your desktop or simply rename the folder.
4.  Proceed to **Appearance > Themes**, deactivate the old theme version, delete it, upload the new one (version 2.0.0) and activate it.  
    Please check the website after the theme activation. As you can see all the content should be setup again. In case you decide to revert to the previous theme version, just upload your old theme version. All content, shortcodes and theme settings will remain the same.
5.  Install and activate **ThemeREX Addons** plug-in.
6.  Enter your **Purchase Code** or **Envato Elements Token** and some personal information. Theme activation allows you to get access to plug-ins, demo content, support and updates.  
      
    To get the **purchase code**, please navigate to your **ThemeForest "Downloads" page** and click on the theme download link. Check this [guide](https://1.envato.market/c/1262870/275988/4415?subId1=ancora&u=help.market.envato.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F202822600-Where-Is-My-Purchase-Code-) for more details.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_activation.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_activation.png)
7.  Install and activate recommented plug-ins in **Appearance > Install Plugins** or just click on the _Begin installing plugins_ link. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/required_plugins_hint.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/required_plugins_hint.png)
8.  Import demo content by navigating to **Theme Panel (WP Dashboard) > Theme Dashboard > Demo Data**.  
      
    
    In case you want to preserve your previous content, we recommend you to use "Partial import" option. In this case the new content will be added to your existing data. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/partial_demo_import.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/partial_demo_import.png)
    
    You can generate pre-built header/footer layouts in [Theme Panel > ThemeREX Addons > Theme Specific > Create Layouts](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#theme_specific).

10.   Please insert all page content (images, text, etc.) through Elementor page builder.

#### Update Option 1. Update using the _ThemeREX Updater_ plug-in

1.  Please make sure the _ThemeREX Updater_ plug-in is installed and activated. This plug-in is provided with the theme.
2.  Optional! If you have activated your [theme copy](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_activation.png) (entered the purchase code or Envato Elements token in the **Theme Panel (WP Dashboard) > Theme Dashboard > General** tab) you can omit this step.  
    Otherwise, navigate to **Appearance > ThemeREX Updater** and enter your purchase code to get the latest versions of bundled plug-ins and theme updates through the WordPress admin panel. To get the code, please navigate to your ThemeForest "Downloads" page and click on the theme download link. Check this [guide](https://1.envato.market/c/1262870/275988/4415?subId1=ancora&u=help.market.envato.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F202822600-Where-Is-My-Purchase-Code-) for more details.  
    Please note, this section requires a **purchase code ONLY!** Envato Elements token will not work here! [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_purchase_code.png) ](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_purchase_code.png)[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_purchase_code_2.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_purchase_code_2.png)
3.  We recommend you to check the "Create backups" option (**Appearance > ThemeREX Updater** tab) to allow the system create backups for plug-ins versions and the theme automatically.
4.  Proceed to **WP Dashboard > Updates** and check if any updates are available. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_update_notices.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_update_notices.png)
5.  Choose the options for an update (plug-in, theme, etc.) and click on Update button.
6.  You can restore the backups created by the system in **WP Dashboard > Updates** or in **Appearance > ThemeREX Updater** (if the "Create backups" option was checked before the update). [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_backups.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_backups.png)

#### Update Option 2. Update using WordPress uploader

1.  Log into your ThemeForest account and navigate to **Downloads** tab. Find the theme and download **Installable WordPress file only**.
    
    ![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/theme_update.jpg)
    
2.  Log into your WordPress website and go to **Appearance > Themes**.
3.  Activate a default WordPress theme. Delete the older version of your theme and re-upload the new **WordPress Installable files** that you have downloaded from ThemeForest during the 1st step.
4.  Once it is uploaded, activate the theme.  
      
    IMPORTANT! If you're using a [child theme](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#installation_child_theme), **do not activate** the newly uploaded **parent theme**. Activate your old child theme instead. Otherwise, **_all the child theme customizations will be lost_**.
5.  Update (if necessary!) the included plug-ins, if you see a notification message prompting about a newer version.
    -   Navigate to **WP Dashboard > Plugins > Installed Plugins**.
    -   Update **ThemeREX Addons** plug-in. You can click on "Update" button (if available in a particular theme) or deactivate and delete this plug-in. Then follow the prompt to install it again. This will load a new plug-in version on the site.
    -   Deactivate and delete the rest plug-in(s) of old version.
    -   Go to **Appearance > Install Plugins** and install the plug-in(s) like it was described in the [Plugins Installation](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#installation_plugins_installation) section of this documentation.

#### Update Option 3. Update using FTP client

1.  Log into your ThemeForest account and get the last version of the theme as described above.
2.  Connect to your server using desktop client software (we recommend Filezilla and CyberDuck).
3.  Change directory to `/wp-content/themes`.
4.  Remove/rename existing folder with old theme files.
5.  Unpack theme installable files downloaded from ThemeForest and upload them to the `themes` folder.
6.  Update (if necessary!) the included plug-ins in the way described above, if you see a notification message prompting about a newer version.

## Theme Customizer

Now let's navigate to **Appearance (WP Dashboard) > Customize** to flexibly control the appearance and behavior of the whole website as well as individual types of posts, pages and categories.  

IMPORTANT! Please be aware that our theme provides a special inheritance hierarchy system for "Theme Options" settings. It means that individual settings of each page may override global settings made with Customizer Panel.  
Settings of "Blog", "WooCommerce", "Plugins settings" (such as Portfolio, Services, Team and Testimonials) and other groups may also override default/general settings available through Customizer.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/customizer.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/customizer.png)

Moreover, you can see the changes of the front-end right after the alterations - when the needed parameter is selected, without switching from admin to front-end each time. When you are done with the changes, you should click on **Publish** button at the top of the Customizer's side menu.

IMPORTANT! Please be aware that all the Customizer's settings are also available for editing through **Theme Panel (WordPress Dashboard Menu) > Theme Options** section. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/customizer_1.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/customizer_1.png)

### Logo & Site Identity

Settings of this group are responsible for managing site identity features. This is the initial place where you should upload your logo.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/logo_site_identity_options.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/logo_site_identity_options.png)

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/logo_site_identity_options_1.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/logo_site_identity_options_1.png)

#### Site Title

The text entered into this field appears as the logo title _(if the image logo is not uploaded and "Use Site Name as Logo" option is enabled)_ and as the website's title in your browser tab.

#### Tagline

The text entered into this field appears as the website slogan under the logo. By default, the tagline is used if no image logo is selected and "Use Site Name as Logo" option is enabled.

You can modify the site **title** and **tagline** appearance by inserting special characters, e.g.:

-   `||` - line break;
-   `{{` ... `}}` - modifies style and color of parts of the text;
-   `[[` ... `]]` - makes the text bold;

#### Site Icon (Favicon)

The site icon (favicon) is used as a browser and app icon for your site. Icons must be square, and at least 512 pixels wide and tall.

#### Logo-related settings

These settings allow managing your logo images (main, for mobile header and mobile menu), as well as their Retina versions (if "Allow retina display logo" option is checked). As a rule, the retina logo should be twice as big as the regular logo in order to be displayed properly.  
Here you can also zoom the logo. 1 - original size. Please note, that the maximum size of the logo depends on the actual size of the image. This option works if max height of the logo is set in `em` in Elementor "Layouts: Logo" widget.  
[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/logo_max_height.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/logo_max_height.png)

**"Use Site Name as Logo"** option displays the site title and tagline as a text logo if no image is selected.

#### Uploading Logo via Layouts

The logo uploaded in the Customizer can be overwritten by the logo image selected in the Header layout. This allows you to upload a different logo image for each page.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_adding_logo.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_adding_logo.png)

**_Available Default Header Style:_** [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/default_header_style.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/default_header_style.png)

The header area in **"Default" style** is created via the Global Customize settings (Appearance > Customize). You can also navigate to the `.../wp-content/themes/tax-help/skins/default/templates/` folder and edit the corresponding template file **header-default.php**.

**Header Position**

The _Header position_ setting controls the way your header behaves in regards to the main body area.

-   **Default** - the default header position. The header occupies a separate section and does not collide with other website elements.
-   **Over** - ideally is used _for pages with sliders_. The header elements overflow the section that follows next, and the header background becomes transparent.
-   **Under** - sets the header area stuck behind the content area when scrolling down the page.

**"Header fullheight"** option enlarges the header area to fill the whole screen. It is used only if the header contains a background image.

**"Header fullwidth"** option stretches the header widgets area to the entire window width.

#### Widgets-related settings

Here you can specify the widgets set for the header area. You can customize the widgets in **Appearance > Widgets** section.

#### Header Style 404

For custom header style please specify the header layout (Dashboard > Layouts tab).

#### Header Background Image-related settings

These settings allow selecting a header background image or background video as well as choosing whether to override the header image with the post's/page's featured image or not.

#### Mobile header settings _(for Default Header style)_

Here you can enable the mobile header. It lets you show/hide such elements as _logo_, _search form_, _login link_, and _shopping cart_. You can also use the **Additional Info section**, a text block where you can add information about your business, such as telephone number, open hours, etc.

-   **Footer widgets** - select a preferred footer widget set. Check the [Widgets section](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#customizer_settings_widgets) for more information.
-   **Footer columns** - set the necessary columns quantity to display the widgets in. Choose `0` to autodetect the number of columns based on how many widgets you have got in the set.
-   **Footer fullwidth** - expands the footer for the whole width of the page.
-   **Copyright** - enter the copyright message. Use the `{Y}` symbol to indicate the current year.

### Mobile

In case you care about the **page speed optimization** and want your website to load faster on mobile devices, this section is just for you. The settings of this group allow you to set separate header and footer layouts as well as specify a sidebar to be displayed **on mobile devices only**.

We recommend you to create alternative custom header and footer layouts for mobile devices (without any hidden elements for other screen resolutions), as these hidden elements still take time while loading your website.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/mobile_options_1.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/mobile_options_1.png)

#### Header-related settings

These settings allow selecting header style and position. For custom header style you can specify the header layout, that is available for customizing in **WP Dashboard > Layouts**.

The _Header position_ setting controls the way your header behaves in regards to the main body area.

-   **Inherit** - the value is inherited from the **Appearance > Customize > Header** section.
-   **Default** - the header occupies a separate section and does not collide with other website elements.
-   **Over** - ideally is used _for pages with sliders_. The header elements overflow the section that follows next, and the header background becomes transparent.
-   **Under** - sets the header area stuck behind the content area when scrolling down the page.

#### Sidebar-related settings

-   **Sidebar position on mobile** - moves sidebar to the right or left hand side of the page, or hides it. The Inherit option inherits the value specified in the **Appearance > Customize > General** panel.  
      
    _Additional options for **"Left/Right"** sidebar position:_  
      
    **Sidebar style** - choose whether to use the default sidebar or custom sidebar layout (available only if the _ThemeREX Addons_ is activated).  
      
    For **"Default"** sidebar style:  
      
    
    -   **Sidebar widgets** - specify which widget set to show in the sidebar area. The widgets are available in **Appearance (WP Dashboard) > Widgets**.
    
    For **"Custom"** sidebar style:  
      
    -   **Select custom layout** - select already built sidebar layout. You can create new sidebar layouts or customize the existing ones in the **Dashboard > Layouts** tab, using a user-friendly Elementor. Check the [Layouts section](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#layouts) for more information.
-   **Content width** - choose the content width if the sidebar is hidden.

#### Footer-related settings

These settings allow selecting a footer style. The Inherit option inherits the value specified in the **Appearance > Customize > Footer** section. For "Default" footer style you can also specify widgets sets and columns quantity. For "Custom" footer style "Select custom layout" option is available. You can manage these footer layouts in the **WP Dashboard > Layouts** tab.

### Menus

Settings of this group are responsible for managing Menus. Each menu location is available for filling with any of the predefined menu sets. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menus_general.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menus_general.png)

**Menus** are also available for editing through the "Appearance > Menus" options. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menus_locations.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menus_locations.png)

**Below are predefined Menu locations:**

-   **Main Menu** - displays the main menu.
-   **Mobile Menu** - displays the menu on mobile devices.

#### Predefined Menu sets:

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menus_main.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menus_main.png)

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menus_1.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menus_1.png)

Within **custom header** & **footer layouts**, you can add menus using the Elementor [Layouts: Menu](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#shortcode_layouts_menu) widget.

We have added the following custom **CSS classes** to stretch the drop-down menu items. The class names should be assigned to the menu items of the first level, like on our demo:

-   `.trx_addons_stretch_window_boxed` - stretches the background of the drop-down menu to the whole window width, though the content stays in the area of limited screen width. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_2.png) ](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_2.png)[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_2_front.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_2_front.png)
-   `.trx_addons_stretch_window` - stretches the drop-down menu to the whole screen width. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_3.png) ](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_3.png)[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_3_front.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_3_front.png)
-   `.columns-X` - "X" is for the number of columns to split your menu items into. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_5.png) ](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_5.png)[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_5_front.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_css_5_front.png)

You can enable or disable the **CSS Classes** option in the [Screen Options](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/menu_screen_options.png) in the top right corner of the WordPress admin.

### Widgets

**Widgets** are the blocks of content that can be placed into specifically designed widget areas.

You can find the list of available widgets and widget areas under **Appearance (WP Dashboard) > Widgets**. Here it is possible to create additional widget sets, that can be assigned to available [default widget areas](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#widget_areas). This is useful when you have different widget sets for different pages. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/appearance_widgets_new.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/appearance_widgets_new.png)

IMPORTANT! Our theme supports both [**Classic Widgets Editor**](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/appearance_widgets.png) and New Block Widgets Editor (WordPress 5.8+). You can easily switch between the editors using the **"Disable new Widgets Block Editor"** option in **Theme Panel (WP Dashboard) > ThemeREX Addons > General** section. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/enable_classic_widgets_editor.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/enable_classic_widgets_editor.png)

#### By default our theme supports 7 widget areas:

-   Header
-   Sidebar
-   Top of the page
-   Above the content
-   Below the content
-   Bottom of the page
-   Footer

 [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/appearance_widgets_list.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/appearance_widgets_list.png)[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widgets_scheme_1.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widgets_scheme_1.png)

You can add widgets into widget areas by simply _dragging and dropping_.

But in order to see them on your website, you need to make sure you have a particular widget set assigned to a particular [default widget area](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#widget_areas). You can assign widget sets either for the **whole website** (in Appearance > Customize), or for a **specific page** (single Page > Theme Options > Content/Widgets/Header/Footer).

IMPORTANT! The **Sidebar**/**Footer** widgets are available for **"Default"** sidebar/footer styles ONLY!  
In order to manage **custom** sidebar or **custom** footer styles, proceed to **Dashboard > Layouts** tab and update the corresponding sidebar/footer layout.

#### Widget Sets Assignment for the Whole Site

**Header widgets** can be assigned in **Appearance > Customize > Header** section.

**Body widgets** (for _sidebar_, _top of the page_, _above the content_, _below the content_ and _bottom of the page_) are accessible in **Appearance > Customize > General** section.  
The sidebar widgets work for _Default Sidebar Style_ only! Otherwise, navigate to the **WP Dashboard > Layouts** tab to manage the sidebar layout.

**Footer widgets** are available for managing in **Appearance > Customize > Footer** section. The footer widgets work for _Default Footer Style_ only! Otherwise, you need to customize the corresponding footer Layout in **WP Dashboard > Layouts**.

#### Widget Sets Assignment for a Specific Page

If you want to specify a widget set for a separate page, open that page in your WordPress admin and in the [Theme Options](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#custom_page_settings) section choose the required widgets. The widgets assigned in Theme Options would be applicable only for that particular page.

#### Customizing Widget Sets that are already enabled on a Specific Page

Depending on the selected page that is available for editing with Customizer's tools, you can notice a different kind of widgets sets included to a particular page. The same can be done through **Appearance (WP Dashboard) > Widgets**. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widgets.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widgets.png)

Below are options responsible for managing widgets/blocks.

-   **Add a Widget** (for Classic Widgets Editor) or **Add a Block** (for New Block Widgets Editor): just click on "Add a Widget/Block" button to see the available widgets, then choose the one you want to use: [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/add_widget.png) ](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/add_widget.png)Click on the block itself to open its **settings** (for New Block Widgets Editor): ![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/gifs/open_block_settings.gif)
-   **Reorder** the position of widgets using three icons:  
      
    -   Move - moves the widget to another sidebar.
    -   Down - moves the widget down.
    -   Up - moves the widget upwards.

After you reorder the position of the widgets/blocks in the sidebar, save your changes.

See the example of how the ****Sidebar Widgets Set**** may look like ("Default" sidebar style):

### Typography

Here you can upload fonts and adjust font settings for specific typography elements.

Check this [article](https://themerex.net/wp/add-new-font/) or [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/7lkZpoqZrpI) for more information on how to add new **Google Fonts** and **Custom Fonts**.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/fonts_settings.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/fonts_settings.png)

The theme enables you to use both Google Fonts and custom fonts in your design. You can load up to 5 different font families, including different styles and weights for each typeface.

IMPORTANT! To manage fonts quantity available for upload, edit `'max_load_fonts' => 5` variable in `theme-specific/theme.setup.php` file.

**The Other font** is used for the following elements:

-   Blockquotes (Gutenberg editor);
-   Content of the testimonials, displayed using the Elementor "Testimonials" widget (ThemeREX Addons Extensions group) in "Bred", "Decoration", "Alter 2", "Alter", "Fashion", "Creative", "Accent 2", "Accent", "Hover", "Common", "List", "Light", "Extra", "Plain", "Simple" and "Default" styles;

### Colors

The theme allows you to assign color schemes to specific parts of your website. This is useful for highlighting certain areas and giving them a distinctive look.

The theme supports 3 color schemes - **default (light)**, **dark** and **alter light**.

Check this [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/B37RBXqPMvk) for more information on how to customize color schemes.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/color_scheme_smpl_options.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/color_scheme_smpl_options.png)

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/color_scheme_smpl_options_1.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/color_scheme_smpl_options_1.png)

IMPORTANT! Due to specifics of CSS rules, you are unable to assign a _light_ color scheme to any website part, if the _dark_ color scheme is enabled.

**Here are the website parts to which you can assign color schemes:**

-   **Show Helpers** - enables a [colored border](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/customizer_color_scheme_helper.png) arround a block in the Customizer with an element's name and color scheme applied to this particular element. The helper can be useful for editing the theme's color schemes. It helps you understand the colors of what elements you are customizing.
-   **Site Color Scheme** - defines the main color scheme of your website. If no other part of website has a color scheme specified explicitly, affects the whole website. Otherwise, affects the body _background color_, body _typography_ and pretty much anything that is located below the header and above the footer areas (except sidebar).
-   **Header Color Scheme** - modifies the color scheme of the header.
-   **Sidebar Color Scheme** - affects the color of the sidebar. The _Inherit_ option inherits the value specified in the **Site Color Scheme** setting.
-   **Footer Color Scheme** - specifies the color of your footer.

You can also assign color schemes for individual pages in the [Theme Options > Colors](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#custom_page_settings) panel of those pages.

#### Color Scheme Editor

Here you can customize the color schemes of your website.

Three additional buttons are available:

-   **Reset** - removes the current changes, made after your last saving.
-   **Copy** - creates a new color scheme by duplicating the default one. Thus, it is possible to set different color schemes for particular pages and their parts.
-   **Delete** - removes the current color scheme. You can delete only newly created color schemes. All default ones will remain.

Select the color scheme you want to customize and choose one of 2 _modes_ (editor types) - **simple** or **advanced**.

In a **simple mode**, you can customize the _accent colors_ (link colors) of a theme. If you want to dig deeper, switch to the **advanced mode**. You can entirely change the theme colors.

Both modes contain the following groups of settings:

**_MAIN_**

The main color group of a website. Here you can find the following elements:

-   **Background color** - the main background color of a website; (for advanced mode only)
-   **Border color** - color used for elements with a border and for content delimiters; (for advanced mode only)
-   **Text** - color for the main _body text_; (for advanced mode only)
-   **Text dark** - color mainly applied for _headings_ and page/post _titles_; (for advanced mode only)
-   **Text light** - color used for additional _meta_ elements, such as _post author_, _date_, _comments_, etc. (for advanced mode only)
-   **Link** - the main accent color of a website. The color can be used as links color, a background color for buttons and the color for minor elements, like list item markers, etc. By default, this setting sets the _Link hover_ color for the Alter color group.
-   **Link hover** - the hover color of the elements with the main accent color and the hover color for links. It can also be used as the main accent color for the Alter color group.
-   **Accent 2** - the second accent color;
-   **Accent 2 hover** - the hover color of the elements with second accent colors;
-   **Accent 3** - the third accent color;
-   **Accent 3 hover** - the hover color of the elements with third accent colors;

**_ALTER_**

Alter means _alternative color group_, mostly applied for sidebar and footer, if a color scheme is assigned to them and it [coincides](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/alter_color_scheme_condition.png) with the site color scheme (NOT inherited). This group of colors can also be applied to page widgets or blocks that are output on some background by default (the background is NOT added through the page builders). Alter colors include the same elements as the Main color group, plus two additional hover colors for _border_ and _background_.

**_EXTRA_**

An additional color group for extra elements such as _dropdowns_, _price blocks_, _table headers_, _blockquotes_, etc.  
As a rule, the text and background colors from the Extra group should contrast against the respective colors from the Main color group.

**_INVERSE (for advanced mode only)_**

_Inverse elements_ are the elements that use the theme accent color (usually the main one) ("Link", "Accent 2", "Accent 3" options) as a background color. In this way, they get distinctive look and stand out from the rest of the content. You can apply these settings for _buttons_, _blockquotes_, _dropdowns_, etc.

-   **Border color**;
-   **Border hover**;
-   **Text color** - the main body text color;
-   **Text dark** - used for headings or other elements that need a darker color;
-   **Text light** - used for meta elements that provide additional information;
-   **Link color** - since the main accent color (i.e. the link color) sets the background color, you need to specify a different link color;
-   **Link hover** - the hover color of the link;

**_INPUT (for advanced mode only)_**

Colors for form fields: _input fields_, _text areas_, _select fields_, etc.

-   **Background** - background color of an input field;
-   **Background hover** - background color when an input field is _active_;
-   **Border color**;
-   **Border hover** - border color when a field is _active_;
-   **Text** - a regular text color;
-   **Text dark** - the color of the text when a field is _active_ (as you type in);
-   **Text light** - used for the _placeholder text_ when a field is _not active_, before you type in;

In case the changes of the color schemes are not applied, please enable **Debug mode** (in Theme Panel > ThemeREX Addons > General tab) and save ThemeREX Addons settings.

### Background

Settings of this group allow editing the background color/image (the one behind the body's content when "Boxed" body style is on).

#### Elementor Page Builder-related tutorials

Usually, the page consists of Sections, Columns, Widgets and some other elements that can be edited via Elementor. Before you start, please check the following tutorials:

1.  [Official Elementor Tips page](https://elementor.com/help/tips-tricks-more/)
2.  [Getting Started With Elementor](https://elementor.com/help/getting-started/)
3.  [Official Documentation for Elementor page builder](https://elementor.com/help/)

#### Custom Page Settings

Each page has a **Theme Options** panel, where you can specify custom page parameters.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/page_theme_options.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/page_theme_options.png)

In **Theme Options**, you can assign a different header/footer style, widgets set, body style, as well as many other options for each individual page.

These settings are applied to the page you are editing, and will overwrite the global settings specified in the Customizer.

**Options Presets Group**

Here you can save the page settings (for header, widgets, footer, etc.) as a **preset template** and duplicate these settings on a new page without checking the required options in each section of Theme Options panel (Content/Widgets/Header/Footer/Colors). All you need to do is to apply the already created preset template on a new page by using **control icons** ("Apply selected preset"/"Create a new preset"/"Delete selected preset"). The tooltips for the icons will help you. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/preset_group.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/preset_group.png)

You can enable or disable the **Theme Options** panel in the [Preferences > Panels](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/screen_options.png) in the top right corner of the WordPress admin.

### Scroll to Content Functionality

In this chapter you will see how to set a scroll to content functionality on single pages/posts. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/gifs/scroll_to_content.gif)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/gifs/scroll_to_content.gif)

An ID `content_skip_link_anchor` is implemented by default to the page and post templates and is assigned to the content area.

If you want to add a scroll to content functionality, you need to open a header layout, insert an icon or a button according to your design and specify `#content_skip_link_anchor` as a link for it. Safe your changes. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/scroll_to_content_header.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/scroll_to_content_header.png)

The link will work automatically. The corresponding anchor is added to the theme core files. No further alterations are necessary.

Alternatively you can use Elementor [Anchor](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#shortcodes_settings_anchor) widget (ThemeREX Addons Elements group) and place this anchor wherever you want on a page with your own links and IDs.

-   `.small_gap` - replaces default margins between images with custom ones (`8px`). This class name should be applied to a Gallery block. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/additional_css_class_15.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/additional_css_class_15.png)
-   `.medium_gap` - replaces default margins between images with custom ones (`30px`). This class name should be applied to a Gallery block.

## Layouts

### Introduction to Layouts

Layouts is a tool that lets you create custom **headers**, **footers**, and other **website sections**, and is based on the [Elementor Page Builder](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#plugins_settings_elementor).

Layouts are available after you activate the _ThemeREX Addons_ plug-in. After the activation, a new menu item appears in your WordPress admin panel.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_adm.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_adm.png)

Your theme comes with a number of [pre-built Layouts](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#layouts_default). If you've imported the [full content](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#whole_demo_content), they will be available for you from the start. Otherwise, you would need to generate them in [Theme Panel > ThemeREX Addons > Theme Specific > Create Layouts](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#theme_specific).

### Creating Layouts

In order to create a layout, navigate to **Layouts (WP Dashboard) > Add New**.

Layouts are built in a similar way you build regular pages with Elementor Page Builder. The difference is that Layouts expand the default list of widgets by adding [layout-specific widgets](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#layouts_widgets) and provide you with [additional section settings](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#layouts_settings).

Please check [this article](https://themerex.net/wp/customize-layouts-elementor/) for detailed information regarding **layouts customization**.  
You can also view our video tutorials about [header](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-7no1Cprk) and [footer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdRXt2KPVRI) layouts customization.

When creating a Layout, first you need to specify the correct **Layout type** in the **Item Options** panel: [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_types.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_types.png)

1.  **Header** - the layout is applied only to output in the header area. It appears in the list of available headers in **Appearance > Customize > Header > Header Style > Custom**.
2.  **Footer** - the layout is applied only to output in the footer area. It appears in the list of available footers in **Appearance > Customize > Footer > Footer Style > Custom**.  
      
    
    You can also choose a different **Header/Footer Layout** for a _specific page_. Simply open that page in the WordPress admin, and in the **Theme Options > Header/Footer** panel edit the _Header Style_ and _Footer Style_ settings.
    
3.  **Submenu** - the layout is used to create custom dropdown menu without installing Uber Menu/Mega Menu plug-ins. You can apply the submenu layout in the **Appearance > Menus > Layout of submenu (optional)** field.  
    "Layout of submenu" field appears only when at least one submenu layout is created.  
    Please view [this article](https://themerex.net/wp/submenu-layouts/) for more information about submenu layouts. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/submenus_layouts.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/submenus_layouts.png)
4.  **Sidebar** - the layout is applied only to output in the sidebar area. It helps create custom sidebars using Elementor page builder. Thus, you are not limited to standard widgets and can use any elements available in the page builder. It appears in the list of available sidebars in the **Appearance > Customize > General/Mobile/Blog/Shop/Plugin Settings** sections or in **page > Theme Options > Content > Sidebar style > Custom**.
5.  **Blog** - custom style or template to output the Blog Stream page or posts elements in Elementor "Blogger" widget, thus creating a blog stream page or page blocks with unique overall look. Use it in combination with _Blog Item Parts_ widget, that lets you insert any post parts (featured image, title, meta data, content, custom fields) to page in any combination and in any quantity.
6.  **Custom** - the standard layout fragment that can be added into a web page using an Elementor Page Builder [Layouts widget](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#shortcodes_settings_layouts).

**Custom Layouts** can be especially useful when you need to use the same section in different places on your website. Instead of building it from scratch on every new page, you can save it as a custom Layout and insert using a Layouts widget.

_In order to add a custom Layout to a web page:_

1.  Add a new Elementor Page Builder section in the website editing screen.
2.  In the left panel with elementor elements open "ThemeREX Addons Layouts" group, drag and drop the Layouts widget from the panel into your section. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/themerex_addons_layouts_group.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/themerex_addons_layouts_group.png)
3.  Choose the desired custom Layout or Elementor's template from the dropdown list ("Type" option should be set to "Default"). [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_widget_list.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_widget_list.png)

**Blog Layout** is just a scheme showing the position of post elements like featured image, post title, meta data, excerpt, etc. Use _Blog Item Parts_ widget to output each element, like in the example below. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/blog_layouts_example.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/blog_layouts_example.png)

_You can apply the blog layouts to:_

-   **Blog Stream Page** - create a page, choose "Blog Archive" template and in the **Theme Options > Content > Blog style** option find your blog layout. Treat the screenshot below just as an example. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/blog_layouts_stream_page.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/blog_layouts_stream_page.png)
-   **Blogger Widget** - open a page/post, in the Elementor widget panel navigate to "ThemeREX Addons Elements group" and insert Blogger widget to the content area. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/blog_layouts_widget.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/blog_layouts_widget.png)

#### Layout Templates

In case there are some page fragments with more or less identical structure, you can create one layout using the Elementor Page Builder, save it as a template and use it as a foundation for your new Layout. Thus, there is no need to create a new layout or block each time. Please see this [article](https://themerex.net/wp/layout-templates-elementor/) for more information.

Open a Layout and click on the _Add Template_ button from the editing screen (Elementor Page Builder's backend editor). Scroll down to view the available templates:

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_templates.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_templates.png)

#### Creating a Mobile Header in Layouts

Layouts is a preferred way of creating a mobile header since it gives you flexibility and control over your elements. Creating a _mobile header_ is similar to creating a standard header, except there are several features you should know about in order to use Layouts more efficiently. Please see the official elementor [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPyBuNLpt4U) or [article](https://themerex.net/wp/build-mobile-header-layouts-elementor/) for more information.

We recommend you to create separate custom header layout for mobile devices and specify it in the **Appearance > Customize > Mobile** section. This will improve the website loading speed on mobile devices.

### Layouts Widgets

Layout-specific widgets are additional widgets available for editing/creating layouts. They are especially useful for building _headers_ and _footers_. You can find layout-specific widgets under the **ThemeREX Addons Layouts** group in the Elementor widgets panel.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/elementor_layout.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/elementor_layout.png)

#### Layouts: Blog Item Parts

Inserts any post parts (featured image, title, meta data, content, custom fields) to your custom page fragment. This widget outputs 1 post part at a time. If you want to create a page block with unique structure, just use as many _"Blog Item Parts"_ widgets as you need and output post parts in any combination and in any quantity.

#### Layouts: Cart

Displays a shopping cart icon (in case the _WooCommerce_ plug-in is active). When clicked, the icon triggers a window with additional shopping details.

For _narrow_ and _normal_ row types, the cart displays the number of products in the cart, the sum total, and an icon label. The _compact_ row type has a shopping cart with a product counter badge only.

#### Layouts: Currency

Displays a currency button, in case the _WooCommerce_ and [WooCommerce Currency Switcher](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-currency-switcher/) plug-ins are active.

#### Layouts: Featured Image

Should be used **for headers only**. Displays a featured image of the current post/page. Often used in combination with the **Title and Breadcrumbs** widget.

The widget has to contain at least one element, otherwise the featured image would be hidden.

#### Layouts: Iconed Text

Inserts an icon and two text lines. It is possible to add a URL to the icon.

#### Layouts

Inserts content in different ways, depending on the type of the layout:

-   **Default** - displays one of the custom layouts available in **WP Dashboard > Layouts** post type. Please click [here](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#layouts_settings_custom) to view the list of available custom layouts.
-   **Popup** - creates popup notifications that appear whenever a user clicks on a link or a button.
-   **Panel** - creates a panel with some content/menu that appears whenever a user clicks on a link or a button.
-   **Panel Menu** - creates a panel with some content/menu that appears whenever a user clicks on a link or a button. You can specify the panel menu style (fullscreen or narrow) and vertical menu style (default or extra).

Select which type of the layout to use in the layouts widget's content settings. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layout_shortcode_types.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layout_shortcode_types.png)

_**The algorithm of building a popup notification or panel:**_

1.  Create a custom layout with required content that will be displayed in the popup window or panel. If you want to use simple text/image or shortcode (like grid gallery, mailchimp form, etc.), just omit this step.
2.  Add a new Elementor Page Builder section to the page. In the left panel with elementor elements open "ThemeREX Addons Layouts" group, drag and drop the Layouts widget from the panel into your section. Select the desired widget's type (popup/panel) and custom Layout from the dropdown list (_Layout_ field) or enter simple text/shortcode/image from the Media Library in the _Content_ field (if "Layout" option is set to "Use content").  
    You may navigate to _Edit Layouts > Advanced_ tab to enclose the elements with paddings or set the background image/color.
3.  In the widget's settings under the **Content** tab, _Popup (panel) ID_ field, **assign the ID** to your popup/panel, e.g. `example_popup`. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layout_shortcode_id.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layout_shortcode_id.png)
4.  Use the **popup/panel ID**, preceded by a pound sign (`#`), as an address for the link or button that should trigger the popup/panel.

#### Layouts: Language

In case the _WPML_ plug-in is active, the widget displays button (drop-down list) that allows choosing the necessary language for the current page.

#### Layouts: Login

Displays a login/logout link with an icon.

The text for the checkbox "I agree..." (registration form) is set in **Appearance > Customize > General > Text with Privacy Policy link**.  
In order to add/customize the Privacy Policy link, navigate to **Settings (WP Dashboard) > Privacy** and specify the page that will be used as a Privacy Policy one.

PLEASE NOTE! In case you are planning to use the registration form without consent checkbox, just leave the "Text with Privacy Policy link" option empty in the **Appearance > Customize > General** section!

#### Layouts: Logo

Inserts a logo (any image). In case there is no logo (both in layouts and in the Customizer), the theme displays the website title and description specified in _Appearance > Customize > Logo & Site Identity_.

**_Uploading Logo_**

The algorithm of our actions would be as follows:

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_adding_logo.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_adding_logo.png)

1.  Select the Layout where you want to place the new logo by going to **Layouts > All Layouts**.
2.  Locate the Elementor **Layouts: Logo** widget (ThemeREX Addons Layouts group) and click on the Edit button.
3.  Upload a new logo in the **panel > Content** tab and save the changes.

IMPORTANT! Logo is available for editing for each particular layout. If no logo is selected in the _Layouts: Logo_ widget, the initial logo from the **Appearance > Customize > Logo & Site Identity** will be used.

#### Layouts: Menu

Displays one of available menus. Specify a preferred menu in the _Menu_ field by its name, like on the screenshot below. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_adding_menu.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_adding_menu.png)

The Layout parameter allows selecting the Menu Layout:

-   **Default** - standard menu with links.
-   **Burger** - just a button that opens Mobile menu.

Direction of the menu items: **Horizontal** or **Vertical**.

Specify default behavior for a responsive menu in the _Content_ tab:

-   **Mobile button** - choose whether to replace the menu with a menu button when switching to the mobile version.
-   **Add to the mobile menu** - use this menu as a mobile menu only.

#### Layouts: Single Post Meta

Displays elements from meta data of the current post (categories, post author, post date, post counters, share links, edit link).

#### Layouts: Search

Adds a search button/input field. There are 3 styles available:

-   **Normal** - a standard search field.
-   **Expand** - displays a search button that expands a search field on click.
-   **Fullscreen** - displays a search button that expands the search field to the entire screen.

#### Layouts: Title

Displays a title and breadcrumbs of the currently opened page/post.

#### Layouts: Widgets

Displays one of the available widget sets (sidebars). You can choose the number of widget columns. In case `0` is chosen, the number of columns equals to the number of widgets in the selected widget set.

### Elementor Section Settings

Layouts have an extended number of settings for **Section**, default Elementor element.

Choose which section you want to edit, click on the [Edit Section](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_edit_section_button.png) button and go to the **panel > Edit Section > Custom Layout**.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_section.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layouts_section.png)

-   **Row type** - defines a row type. It accepts the following values:
    1.  **Inherit** - a default row with no layout-specific styles applied.
    2.  **Narrow** - the smallest type of row. The Elementor widgets feature a small font size and small icons. The **Layouts: Iconed Text** widget places text in 1 line (even for two-line option).
    3.  **Compact** - a smaller variation of the **normal** row type. The Elementor widgets have a standard font size and small icons. The **Iconed Text** widget puts text in 1 line (even for the two-line option).
    4.  **Normal** - a row of a normal height. The Elementor widgets inserted into this type of row have a standard font size, and medium-sized icons. The **Layouts: Iconed Text** widget features text divided into 2 lines.
-   **Delimiter** - adds a border to the row's bottom.
-   **Fix this row when scroll** - 'fixes' the row to the top of the page (or to the last 'fixed row'). Useful for creating sticky navigation.  
    To avoid "Sticky Menu" behavior select "Don't fix" option.  
      
    -   **Delay before fix this row** - the row goes beyond the edge of the window, then "returns" animatedly and sticks.
    -   **Hide this row on unfix** - hides the row until scrolling down.
-   **Hide on the Frontpage** - hides the row on the page assigned as the **Homepage** (Frontpage) in _Settings > Reading_. In case the Blog Feed page is assigned as the Homepage, the row stays _visible_.
-   **Hide on single posts and pages** - hides the row on single pages and posts.
-   **Hide on other pages** - hides the row on pages that are not single ones (other than `is_singular()`).

## Custom Post Types

A custom post type is an additional type of posts that is tailored for a specific kind of content. Custom post types are a part of the _ThemeREX Addons plug-in_, and you can use them after the plug-in activation.

**Custom Post Types** support icons from standard **Fontello** icons set. You can expand the list of available icons by adding new ones from the [fontello website](http://fontello.com/). In order to add new icons proceed to `wp-content/themes/your-theme/skins/default/css/font-icons/config.json`. Watch this [video guide](https://youtu.be/7f96tUTLmq4) for more information.  
_Please note, the location of `config.json` file and website page builder with available set of widgets/shortcodes in your theme may vary from the video provided!_

### Portfolio

If you want to add a portfolio section to your web page, you need to create the portfolio posts and display them using the [Elementor Portfolio widget](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#shortcodes_settings_portfolio) (ThemeREX Addons Extensions group).

In order to create a new portfolio post, click on **Portfolio > Add New** in your WordPress dashboard.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/cpt_portfolio_adm.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/cpt_portfolio_adm.png)

Below is an example of the back-end view of a single portfolio post. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/cpt_portfolio_post.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/cpt_portfolio_post.png)

Apart from the standard fields, such as title, description, portfolio group, excerpt, and featured image, you can use additional fields in the **Item Options** panel:

-   **Style** - select project details style.
-   **General** - specify project's subtitle, alternative external link and project's author. Available authors are accessible through the [Team post type](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#custom_post_types_team).
-   **Project Details** - additional information about the project. Add as many items as needed. Clone items by clicking a clone button in the top right corner, or rearrange them using the drag button in the top left corner. Here you can also choose the position of the block with project's details displayed on single portfolio posts.
-   **Gallery** - create a gallery for a single page of this project.

## Elementor Widgets

Elementor Widgets in WordPress let you add different kinds of functionality to your website without writing a single line of code.

Our theme comes with a number of custom Elementor widgets allowing you to add the information in a simple way.

**Custom Elementor widgets** (with icon functionality) support icons from standard **Fontello** icons set. You can expand the list of available icons by adding new ones from the [fontello website](http://fontello.com/). In order to add new icons proceed to `wp-content/themes/your-theme/skins/default/css/font-icons/config.json`. Watch this [video guide](https://youtu.be/7f96tUTLmq4) for more information.  
_Please note, the location of `config.json` file and website page builder with available set of widgets/shortcodes in your theme may vary from the video provided!_

All custom Elementor widgets are divided into the following groups of elements in the Elementor Editor:

[ThemeREX Addons Elements group](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#elements_group)

#### Audio Effects

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trx_sc_audio_effect.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trx_sc_audio_effect.png)

This widget allows you to build unique linked banners, assembled through Elementor page builder.

2.  Add a new Elementor Page Builder section to the page. In the left panel with elementor elements open "ThemeREX Addons Layouts" group, drag and drop the Layouts widget from the panel into your section. Select the desired widget's type (popup/panel) and custom Layout from the dropdown list (_Layout_ field) or enter simple text/shortcode/image from the Media Library in the _Content_ field (if "Layout" option is set to "Use content").  
    You may navigate to _Edit Layouts > Advanced_ tab to enclose the elements with paddings or set the background image/color.
3.  In the widget's settings under the **Content** tab, _Popup (panel) ID_ field, **assign the ID** to your popup/panel, e.g. `example_popup`. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layout_shortcode_id.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/layout_shortcode_id.png)

## ThemeREX Addons

These add-ons allow you to use custom widget sets and custom Elementor widgets, show custom post types, set links to your social profiles as well as some advanced theme-specific settings.

After plug-in's installation, the "ThemeREX Addons" menu item should appear in the "Theme Panel" tab in WordPress dashboard menu panel. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trex_addons_settings.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trex_addons_settings.png)

Below is a brief description of all the available settings.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trex_addons_settings_general.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trex_addons_settings_general.png)

#### General Settings

-   **Debug Mode** - Enable debug functions and theme profiler output.  
      
    IMPORTANT! There is a separate file for each script snippet `.js` and style related `.css` data. For better theme performance the system automatically re-compiles/re-merges these files into a single `.js/.css` related one after every "Save Options" button click in Customizer (Appearance > Customize) and ThemeREX Addons settings (Theme Panel > ThemeREX Addons).  
    In case the "Debug Mode" is on, the theme does not run the re-compile/re-merge mode, so each and every file loads separately. That is why we do recommend to turn this mode on only if you need to edit/customize the source script and style related files. Please do not edit the following (re-merged) files: `trx_addons.css`, `trx_addons.js`, `__colors.css`, `__style.css`, `__scripts.js`.
-   **Disable new Widgets Block Editor** - disable new Widgets Block Editor, if after the update to WordPress 5.8+ you are having trouble with editing widgets or working in Customizer. New Widgets Block Editor is used in WordPress 5.8+ instead of classic widgets panel.

-   **Quality for cropped images** - Specify range of quality (1-100) to save cropped images.  
      
    
    PLEASE NOTE If you change the images quality, do not forget to regenerate the thumbnails again.
    
      
    
-   **Animate inner links** - This setting adds "smooth scroll" effect to the inner page links.
-   **Open external links in a new window** - If checked, this setting adds parameter `target="_blank"` to all external links.

## Advanced Theme Add-ons

Advanced theme add-ons enhance the functionality of a WordPress theme. They come prepacked with the theme and require _ThemeREX Addons_ plug-in to be active.

Once you have activated your theme (entered your purchase code), please navigate to the **Theme Panel (WP Dashboard) > Theme Dashboard > Addons** tab and make sure that all advanced add-ons, provided with the theme, are active. Now you can proceed with demo data installation and further theme customization. Here you can activate/deactivate, download or update add-ons if needed. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/advanced_theme_addons_2.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/advanced_theme_addons_2.png)

PLEASE NOTE! The following advanced theme add-ons come with the theme.

### Audio Effects Add-on

With the help of Audio Effects Add-on you can easily set music on page loading, background music, sound effects on mouse events (click, hover, etc.) on your website.

Once the add-on is active, "Audio Effects" section will appear in **Theme Panel (WP Dashboard) > ThemeREX Addons**. These are the **global settings**. Here you can select the post types for adding params with audio effects, enable audio effects for the entire site and set the behavior of each default sound effect globally. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trex_addons_settings_audio_effects.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trex_addons_settings_audio_effects.png)

If you have enabled the audio effects for a definite post type, you will gain control over the sound effects on **single posts/pages** from this post type in their **Item Options** settings. These individual settings of each page/post may override global settings made with "Theme Panel (WP Dashboard) > ThemeREX Addons". [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/audio_effects_page.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/audio_effects_page.png)

Moreover, the sounds on hover can be added **individually to any page element** through Elementor settings of a definite widget. Open the widget, proceed to **Advanced** tab and in the "Audio Effects" section specify the needed parameters. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/audio_effects_page_blocks.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/audio_effects_page_blocks.png)

In order to let your customers turn on/off the sounds on a single page/post themselves, please use the Elementor **"Audio Effects"** widget, that adds an equalizer (sound) icon to your page. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/audio_effects_el_widget.png) ](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/audio_effects_el_widget.png)[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trx_sc_audio_effect.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/trx_sc_audio_effect.png)

The following statuses of the indicator are available:

-   **Static enabled** - sounds effects only (hover, click), without background music;
-   **Animated** - all sounds are turned on;
-   **Static disabled** - all sounds are turned off;

PLEASE NOTE! The sounds indicator controlls only advanced sounds effects. Its actions do not apply to video and audio sounds that are created using video/audio widgets or external plug-ins.

### Background Text Add-on

This add-on is imbedded into the theme and can not be deactivated. The add-on enhances the Elementor functionality by adding **"Background Text" parameters** to **Elementor sections (rows)** helping you create **background text lines** and **animate** them, when they enter the visible area of ​​the window. You can also make this text "scroll", like in a **news ticker**. In this case after the entrance animation the background text starts scrolling continuously.

![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/gifs/background_text_example2.gif)

In order to decorate your theme, open your page through the Elementor page builder, find the page row (Elementor section) to which the "background text" functionality you would like to apply and proceed to **Edit Section > Advanced > Background text** in the Elementor widgets panel. Here you can specify the text, text color, font family, font size, text shadow and other parameters for your background line. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/el_background_text.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/el_background_text.png)

**Below you can find some clarifications of the basic options:**

-   **Top offset** and **Left offset** - Shift the text. The shift point is the top left corner of a section.
-   **Entrance effect** - Choose appearance effect.  
      
    -   **Slide** - symbols appear one by one from left to right;
    -   **Rotate** - symbols rotate one by one from top to bottom;
    ![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/gifs/background_text_example.gif)
-   **Marquee speed** - Set the scrolling speed. If the option is set to `0`, it means without scrolling.
-   **Reverse movement** - Make the text scroll in the opposite direction: for regular text - from right to left, for RTL text - from left to right.
-   **Overlay image** and **Overlay position** - Place an image (`.png`) over a background text line to add a "texture" effect to it.

### Dynamic Background Add-on

The Dynamic Background Add-on allows you to create unusual background effects for some page elements. It fills the page section with background color gradually in a form of a circle or with fade effect, while you are scrolling down the page.

Once the add-on is active, a **"Dynamic Background"** section will appear in the Elementor widgets' settings, under **"Advanced" tab**. These settings are available for **page elements** (icon, title, text, image, etc.) and NOT for sections and columns. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/dynamic_background_settings.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/dynamic_background_settings.png)

In order to add such effect to your page, please choose a **page element** (icon, title, text, image, etc.) and in the widget's settings identify this page element as a **Starting** point. Specify the rest parameters, like ID, background effect, background color, delay, etс. Now you need to find another page element and identify it as an **End** point.

The effect begins when your starting breakpoint becomes visible in the window and lasts till the end breakpoint reaches the visible area of the window. The starting and end breakpoints **should have the same ID** to make a "pair". [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/dynamic_background_id.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/dynamic_background_id.png)

The **"Shift" option** indicates the shift in percentage (from `-100%` to `100%` of the screen height) of the start/end point of the effect from the bottom of the window, which is the default point of moving.  
_The negative shift_ means that the start/end point of the effect will not reach the bottom of the window.  
_The positive shift_ means that the effect will start/end when the point reaches the bottom of the window and moves set distance downward (in percentage from the window height).

The sections with dynamic background effects can intersect.

PLEASE NOTE!Please also view this [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/n7Pz4IK_HLk) on how to customize/create the dynamic background.

### Image Effects Add-on

After add-on's activation, the **"Image effects"** section will appear in the Elementor widgets panel for **Elementor "Image"** widget under **Content** tab. Here you can select the image hover effect from the drop-down list and specify the needed parameters. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/image_hover_settings.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/image_hover_settings.png)

In case you want the mouse helper to display some special information for a **definite page section** or just change the cursor style over a **specific section/element**, you can proceed to the Elementor widgets panel, enable the mouse helper for a particular section/column/widget and specify additional settings (text, background image, icon, etc.) in the **Advanced > Mouse Helper** section. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/elementor_mouse_helper.png) ](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/elementor_mouse_helper.png)[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/elementor_mouse_helper_settings.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/elementor_mouse_helper_settings.png)

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/mouse_helper_el_option.png) ](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/mouse_helper_el_option.png)_View on Hover_ [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/mouse_helper_el_option_front.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/mouse_helper_el_option_front.png)

### Slider Revolution

If you need to display **posts, pages, or custom post types** in a form of a slider, also check out [Swiper Slider](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#shortcodes_settings_slider).

Our theme is fully compatible with an extremely powerful **Revolution Slider** plug-in. It allows you to create an unlimited number of sliders and set anywhere you want on the page within the necessary widget. Please view [our article](https://themerex.net/wp/slider-revolution/) for more information about revolution slider customization.

Check the following links for more information regarding the **Revolution Slider** functionality:

1.  [Slider usage Example and how-tos](https://www.sliderrevolution.com/examples/)
2.  [Support center + FAQs and Documentation](https://www.sliderrevolution.com/help-center)

Below is an example of the Revolution Slider's main page back-end (default slider style with slides): [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widget_slider_back.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widget_slider_back.png)

Custom CSS code is specified in **Module General Options > CSS/jQuery** section. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/revslider_css.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/revslider_css.png)

#### Slider Revolution with images from posts/pages, etc.

The Revolution slider also allows you to use the images from the already created website elements like posts/pages as well as from social profiles streams, etc. This method also preserves adding the needed information (text/buttons) or effects via slider layers. Such images can be specified in Slider Settings. Just open a particular slider, navigate to "Module General Options" tab (gear icon) and set the required parameters in the **Content** section.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/rev_slider_posts.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/rev_slider_posts.png)

#### Add Slider Revolution via Elementor Widget

You can add sliders to your page using elements in Elementor Page Builder. Insert either the _Revolution Slider_ widget (WordPress group) or [Slider widget](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#shortcodes_settings_slider) (ThemeREX Addons Elements group) to the page and choose **slider engine** - _Slider Revoluion_. You can also use a shortcode, like `[rev_slider alias="slider-1"][/rev_slider]`.

[![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/slider_revolution_widget.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/slider_revolution_widget.png)

#### Add Slider Revolution via Widgets area

You can also add Slider Revolution via widgets and place the slider not only in the header of the page (might vary, depending on [default sidebars locations](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#widget_areas) available for a particular theme).

Please note! In case you do not have a slider set up (but the Revolution Slider plug-in is already installed), you need to create it first and fill with slides by navigating to **Slider Revolution** tab in the WP Dashboard side menu.

1.  Navigate to the **Appearance > Widgets** in the WordPress dashboard menu.
2.  Locate the **Revolution Slider** widget and drag and drop it to any of the available widget sets. Specify the necessary parameters and click on "Save" button. See the example below. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widget_slider_add.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widget_slider_add.png)
3.  Navigate to the page on which you want your slider to appear and enable the necessary widget area in the [Theme Options](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/#custom_page_settings) panel. For example, let's activate Slider in the "Header Widgets" section (Theme Options > Header tab). [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widget_slider_add_theme_options.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/widget_slider_add_theme_options.png)
4.  Once it's finished click "Update" and "Preview Changes" buttons to see how it will look on the front-end.

### ThemeREX Updater

### WooCommerce

WooCommerce is an industry leader e-commerce plug-in for WordPress. Our theme is fully compatible with this great tool, allowing you to turn your website into sales machine in just a few clicks. You simply need to install this plug-in and allow it to create a set of pages to display categories, products etc. Then you need to add a set of products.

We highly encourage you to read the great documentation files WooCommerce offers. These manuals help to create effective and reliable on line stores providing more features than you can imagine. Here is a list of **really** useful links helping you create and polish your shop.

## Theme Translation

We recommend using **Poedit** software for translation-related purposes.

To translate the theme to your language, please follow these steps:

1.  Download and install [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) software. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_website.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_website.png)
2.  Navigate to the `theme/skins/default/languages/` folder and locate `.pot` file. Copy it to your desktop for editing. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_file.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_file.png)
3.  Double click on the `.pot` file. In the **Poedit** window click on the "Create New Translation" button, choose the necessary language of the translation from the dropdown list and click "OK." [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_1.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_1.png)
4.  Now select the constant text string you need to translate from the "Source text - English" field and type in the necessary translation into the "Translation" field.  
    You can translate as much as you want, just go through the file and click on each string in "Poedit" and add your translation. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_2.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_2.png)
5.  Next, you have to save the changes to your `.po` file using the naming convention based on the language code (e.g. `pt` for Portuguese) followed by the country code (for instance `_BR` for Brazil). To do that click on the "sheet" icon (you can also use hotkeys `CMD` + `Shift` + `S` in OS X or **Win+S** in Windows) and type in the name according to the screenshot below.  
    The first lower-case letters define the language, whereas the second upper-case letter defines the country. In most cases, the language and country are the same, like “de\_DE” for Germany.  
    However, there is a difference for languages like English or Portuguese, which are spoken in several countries natively. In this case, the difference is in the first and second letter pairs; for the UK, the code would be en\_GB, whereas the en\_US stands for the USA. If you are not familiar with the codes for your native language and country, then visit the GNU website. See [Language Codes](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Language-Codes) and [Country Codes](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Country-Codes) for the lists of codes.  
      
    PLEASE NOTE! If you use the wrong naming convention WordPress can not process your translation. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_3.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_3.png)
6.  When saving your `.po` file, Poedit automatically creates a new `.mo` file, with the same naming convention. According to the example above, the file would be called **pt\_BR.mo**. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_4.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/poedit_4.png)
7.  Upload the `.po` and `.mo` files you just created to the `.../languages` folder. Make sure these files are in the same directory as the `default.pot` one.
8.  Our theme is using **ThemeREX Addons** plug-in, so some translation should be done in language files of this plug-in in the `.../wp-content/plugins/trx_addons/languages` directory. There is also a `trx_addons.pot` file in this directory.  
    Generate the `.po` and `.mo` files according to your language. See the file names on the example below:  
    `trx_addons-pt_BR.po`, `trx_addons-pt_BR.mo`.  
    Make sure that the language of your files is the same as in your **WordPress admin panel > Settings > General Settings** section.

For more information on how to use Poedit, please check the following resources:

## Page Speed Optimization

This chapter is for those who whould like to speed up their websites and care about the page loading speed. There are a lot of different ways to make your website work faster, but we will focus on **caching plug-ins** we have used on our demos, though they are **not provided** with the theme.

A lot of users access the website at the same time. This makes the server work slowly and takes more time to load the web page for each user. **Caching** is the way to store the current version of your web page on the server and prevent from sending requests to the server for each user each time.

Below you can find short description of the caching plug-in we have used on our demo as well as its main settings. Please feel free to play around with the plug-in's settings yourself in order to receive the better result.

### WP-Optimize - Clean, Compress, Cache

WP-Optimize is all-in-one WordPress performance plug-in _(not provided with the theme)_ that is responsible for cleaning your database, compressing images and caching your website.

Please check the links below for more information about this plug-in:

1.  [Official plug-in page](https://getwpo.com/)
2.  [WordPress plug-in page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/)
3.  [Official plug-in documentation](https://getwpo.com/documentation/)

PLEASE NOTE! There is **no unique recommended configuration** of the plug-in's settings, suitable for every website. Please find out your own best combination of settings.

Once the plug-in is active, the **WP-Optimize** section will appear in your WordPress Dashboard. [![](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/wp_optimize_settings.png)](https://tax-help.ancorathemes.com/doc/images/wp_optimize_settings.png)
