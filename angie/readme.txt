== Description ==

**Disclaimer:** Angie is currently in a Beta mode. While core functionality in WordPress and the Elementor Editor is stable and ready to explore, some integrations with other plugins and tools are still evolving and may not work as expected yet. We're continuously improving Angie and expanding these integrations, so you can expect broader, more refined capabilities soon. In the meantime, be sure to back up your site before using Angie.

Manage and update your website by chatting with Angie, a powerful Agentic AI for any WordPress website. With your instruction, Angie can perform simple or complex multi-step workflows and bulk actions in an instant, to multiply your productivity across any part of website creation.

Perfect for professional web creators, agencies, freelancers, and professional site owners who want to work smarter and achieve more.

Capture the power of MCP (Model Context Protocol) technology and autonomous AI Agents to carry out multi-step tasks like updating pages, installing plugins, bulk uploading new inventory to your WooCommerce store, or generating entire landing pages, all executed intelligently and in context. Angie frees you from repetitive admin work so you can focus on strategy and creativity, while your AI assistant runs your WordPress site seamlessly.
